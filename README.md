## I'm a Full Stack Developer Mode
A "client" has approached you and asked you to help them build a web presence. They are a local restaurant called Wild Thyme Gourmet. They don't know anything about the Internet, but they know they need a web page. They want an interactive menu that displays all of their food choices with prices, descriptions, etc. They also want the customer to be able to select menu items and create an order with a total price. When the user saves the order, it should alert the user that their order was placed and empty the current order.
Use create-react-app to to create an updating menu page. See Additional Resources for an example of an actual restaurant page.
